# Restaurant-Revenue-Predictor

This project aims to build an application that predicts restaurant revenue using machine learning, specifically a multilinear regression model. The goal is to create a Python-based solution that uses various features, such as seating capacity, average meal price, marketing budgeting, or other restaurant-specific data, to forecast how much revenue a restaurant might generate.<br>
Here’s a high-level outline of the project:<br>
Key Components:<br>
1.	Data Collection:<br>
o	Gather historical data on restaurant revenue along with features like location, time, day, promotions, and any other relevant data that may influence revenue.<br>
2.	Data Preprocessing:<br>
o	Clean the data and handle missing values.<br>
o	Remove outliers among features columns<br>
3.	Feature Engineering:<br>
o	Select relevant features that may impact restaurant revenue (e.g., Seating Capacity, Average Meal Price, Marketing Budget).<br>
4.	Model Building:<br>
o	Start with a multilinear regression model to predict restaurant revenue.<br>
o	Use libraries such as scikit-learn for the regression algorithm.<br>
o	Train the model on historical data and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Test Mean ABSOLUTE Error(MAE) and Train Mean Absolute Error (MAE)<br>
5.	Model Improvement:<br>
o	Investigate the use of other regression algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting methods, to enhance prediction accuracy.<br>
o	Implement feature transformations (e.g., polynomial features) to improve the model's predictive power.<br>

6.	Streamlit Application:<br>
o	Use Streamlit to build a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.<br>
o	The app should allow the user to input restaurant data (like location, day, time, etc.) and receive revenue predictions.<br>
o	The app should also include visualization (graphs, charts) to show how features impact the revenue predictions.<br>
7.	Deployment:<br>
o	Host the Streamlit application on a platform like Heroku or Streamlit Sharing for easy access and usage.<br>
o	Provide a GitHub repository with all the code, instructions, and documentation for anyone who wants to replicate or contribute to the project.<br>

Project Steps<br>
1. Setup Python Environment:<br>
•	Install the necessary libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, streamlit, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.<br><br>
•	Set up a GitHub repository for version control and project management.<br>
2. Preprocessing the Data:<br>
•	Load the data using pandas.<br>
•	Identify and handle missing values.<br>
•	Perform encoding for categorical variables like location.<br>
•	Scale the features if necessary (e.g., MinMax scaling for numerical features).<br>
3. Building the Regression Model:<br>
•	Use scikit-learn to split the data into training and testing sets.<br>
•	Train a Multilinear Regression model and evaluate its performance.<br>
•	Test the model with new data to ensure its accuracy.<br>


4. Improving the Model:<br>
•	Compare the performance metrics for each model and choose the one that works best.<br>
5. Building the Streamlit App:<br>
•	Develop a basic interface with input fields where users can enter data (e.g., location, time, day).<br>
•	Use the trained model to predict the restaurant's revenue based on the user's input.<br>
•	Display the result on the page, along with visualizations (e.g., a bar chart or line graph showing the predicted vs. actual revenue).<br>
Example of how to use Streamlit:<br>
import streamlit as st<br>
import pandas as pd<br>
import numpy as np<br>
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression<br>

st.title("Restaurant Revenue Prediction")# load the file that contains the model (model.pkl)<br>
with open("model.pkl", "rb") as f:<br>
  model = pickle.load(f)<br>

# give the Streamlit app page a title<br>
st.title("Restaurant Revenue Predictor")<br>

# input widget for getting user values for X (feature matrix value)<br>
Seating_Capacity = st.slider("Seating Capacity", min_value=0, max_value=100, value=20)<br>
Average_Meal_Price= st.slider("Average Meal Price", min_value=0, max_value=100, value=20)<br>
Marketing_Budget = st.slider("Marketing Budget [thousand]", min_value=0, max_value=10000, value=20)<br>



# After selesting Revenue, the user then submits the price value<br>
if st.button("Predict"):<br>
  # take the price value, and format the value the right way<br>
  prediction = model.predict([[Seating_Capacity, Average_Meal_Price, Marketing_Budget]])[0].round(2)<br>
  st.write("Expected Revenue ", prediction, "thousand dollars")<br>

# Input fields for the user<br>
# load the file that contains the model (model.pkl)<br>
with open("model.pkl", "rb") as f:<br>
  model = pickle.load(f)<br>

# give the Streamlit app page a title<br>
st.title("Restaurant Revenue Predictor")<br>

# input widget for getting user values for X (feature matrix value)<br>
Seating_Capacity = st.slider("Seating Capacity", min_value=0, max_value=100, value=20)<br>
Average_Meal_Price= st.slider("Average Meal Price", min_value=0, max_value=100, value=20)<br>
Marketing_Budget = st.slider("Marketing Budget [thousand]", min_value=0, max_value=10000, value=20)<br>



# After selesting Revenue, the user then submits the price value<br>
if st.button("Predict"):
  # take the price value, and format the value the right way<br>
  prediction = model.predict([[Seating_Capacity, Average_Meal_Price, Marketing_Budget]])[0].round(2)<br>
  st.write("Expected Revenue ", prediction, "thousand dollars")<br>

6. Deployment:<br>
•	Host the application on Streamlit Sharing or a similar platform.<br>
•	Share the GitHub repository containing all the code and instructions to allow others to run the project locally.<br>
Potential Challenges and Solutions:<br>
•	Handling Missing Data: Missing values can be handled by imputation or removing rows/columns with too many missing values.<br>
•	Categorical Data Encoding: Converting categorical variables like location into numerical values can be done using techniques like one-hot encoding.<br>
•	Scalability: As the dataset grows, it might be necessary to optimize the app and the model to handle larger volumes of data efficiently.<br>
