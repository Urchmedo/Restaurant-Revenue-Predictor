# Restaurant-Revenue-Predictor

This project aims to build an application that predicts restaurant revenue using machine learning, specifically a multilinear regression model. The goal is to create a Python-based solution that uses various features, such as seating capacity, average meal price, marketing budgeting, or other restaurant-specific data, to forecast how much revenue a restaurant might generate.
Here’s a high-level outline of the project:
Key Components:
1.	Data Collection:
o	Gather historical data on restaurant revenue along with features like location, time, day, promotions, and any other relevant data that may influence revenue.
2.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Clean the data and handle missing values.
o	Remove outliers among features columns
3.	Feature Engineering:
o	Select relevant features that may impact restaurant revenue (e.g., Seating Capacity, Average Meal Price, Marketing Budget).
4.	Model Building:
o	Start with a multilinear regression model to predict restaurant revenue.
o	Use libraries such as scikit-learn for the regression algorithm.
o	Train the model on historical data and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Test Mean ABSOLUTE Error(MAE) and Train Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
5.	Model Improvement:
o	Investigate the use of other regression algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting methods, to enhance prediction accuracy.
o	Implement feature transformations (e.g., polynomial features) to improve the model's predictive power.

6.	Streamlit Application:
o	Use Streamlit to build a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.
o	The app should allow the user to input restaurant data (like location, day, time, etc.) and receive revenue predictions.
o	The app should also include visualization (graphs, charts) to show how features impact the revenue predictions.
7.	Deployment:
o	Host the Streamlit application on a platform like Heroku or Streamlit Sharing for easy access and usage.
o	Provide a GitHub repository with all the code, instructions, and documentation for anyone who wants to replicate or contribute to the project.

Project Steps
1. Setup Python Environment:
•	Install the necessary libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, streamlit, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
•	Set up a GitHub repository for version control and project management.
2. Preprocessing the Data:
•	Load the data using pandas.
•	Identify and handle missing values.
•	Perform encoding for categorical variables like location.
•	Scale the features if necessary (e.g., MinMax scaling for numerical features).
3. Building the Regression Model:
•	Use scikit-learn to split the data into training and testing sets.
•	Train a Multilinear Regression model and evaluate its performance.
•	Test the model with new data to ensure its accuracy.


4. Improving the Model:
•	Compare the performance metrics for each model and choose the one that works best.
5. Building the Streamlit App:
•	Develop a basic interface with input fields where users can enter data (e.g., location, time, day).
•	Use the trained model to predict the restaurant's revenue based on the user's input.
•	Display the result on the page, along with visualizations (e.g., a bar chart or line graph showing the predicted vs. actual revenue).
Example of how to use Streamlit:
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

st.title("Restaurant Revenue Prediction")

# Input fields for the user
location = st.selectbox("Select Location", ["Location1", "Location2", "Location3"])
day = st.selectbox("Day of the Week", ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"])
time_of_day = st.slider("Select Time of Day", 0, 24, 12)

# Predict revenue using the model (dummy logic for example)
predicted_revenue = model.predict([[location, day, time_of_day]])

st.write(f"Predicted Revenue: {predicted_revenue[0]}")

6. Deployment:
•	Host the application on Streamlit Sharing or a similar platform.
•	Share the GitHub repository containing all the code and instructions to allow others to run the project locally.
Potential Challenges and Solutions:
•	Handling Missing Data: Missing values can be handled by imputation or removing rows/columns with too many missing values.
•	Categorical Data Encoding: Converting categorical variables like location into numerical values can be done using techniques like one-hot encoding.
•	Scalability: As the dataset grows, it might be necessary to optimize the app and the model to handle larger volumes of data efficiently.
